# QuizApp
A project work on Android Basic challenge.
This is the final project of the QuizApp
****************************************
This quiz have simple interface jet it meets it requirement by conducting a Quiz on 
physics my favorite subject.

To start a user must enter his/her name and class and then select from the multiple
selection and enter their answer where it is needed.

When all questions are answered the user can then press the CHECK RESULTS button to see the result
which displays a summary of the results including their name and class in a Toast message.

To take the quiz again, the user can use the TRY AGAIN button to clear the fields and answer the questions
again.

This App takes into consideration of some errors where a user may not enter their name, class,
wrong input and not selecting an answer at all, there are mechanism to check all that, so that users don't do what they 
want.
